	<p align="center">Information on the different types of reported hate crimes can be found in the Crime Ranking tab, where states are ordered from the highest crimes reported per capita to lowest.
	  On the Political Affliation tab we subset each state by their political affliation according to data collected from the 2012 political election and compute summary statistics of crimes reported.</p>
