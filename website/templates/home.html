	<p align="center">This app is based on a compilation of <strong>hate crimes in the United States</strong> reported to the FBI during the year 2013.</p>
	<p align="center">Information on the different types of reported hate crimes can be found in the <strong>Crime Ranking</strong> tab, where states are ordered from the highest crimes reported per capita to lowest.
	  On the <strong>Political Affliation</strong> tab we subset each state by their political affliation according to data collected from the 2012 political election and compute summary statistics of crimes reported.</p>
